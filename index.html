    <h1>Housing Matchmaker | Jackson, New Hampshire</h1>
    <p>
      This platform helps connect people looking for housing with community
      members who have ADUs or other rentals to offer. The Jackson Housing
      Commission reviews every application by hand. This is a human guided
      process that aims to make thoughtful matches, but it cannot guarantee
      housing. Whether you are seeking a home or offering one, we are glad you
      are here.
